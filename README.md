# Mobile Phone Benchmark Application
A Benchmark Application written in Java with Android SDK for a school project.

The Benchmark target picked for this project is CPU and Threading. Program runs a costly floating point calculation through CPU, 
based on the choice of the user this is single threaded and multi threaded.

After the benchmark finishes the program calculates a score for the benchmark and also displays some other vital information.

I also wrote a java code that mimicks way WEB handles screen oriantation. Normally in Android it is expected of developer to write completely different two xml files for each oriantation. I wanted a one that will adjust layout according to the oriantation instead of making me write same xml file twice with a single line change.
